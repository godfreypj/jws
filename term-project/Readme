## Hospital Records

This is an example of a Restlet service `records` running on localhost with the base URL `http://localhost:8080/records/resourcesP/`.

## Deploying/Usage
1. Compile/deploy with the Ant script: ant -Dwar.name=records deploy

The database is broken up into 2 files: doctors.db and patients.db; they are related by the ID of the Doctor.

`doctors.db` is a database file consisting of strings of doctors and their 4 digit ids separated by an exclamation point:
```php
Dr.Smith!3254
Dr.Bob!5940
Dr.Lane!4532
```
`patients.db` is a database file consisting of strings of patients, their insurance numbers (3 digits preceded by an I), and their doctors ID separated by exclamation points:
```php
Sally!I123!3254
Stan!I456!3254
Brian!I565!3254
Sally!I987!5940
Steve!I090!4532
Rachel!I433!4532
```
